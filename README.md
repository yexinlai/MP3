MP3: Dynamic Multi-Point Prompt Propagation for SAM2-based CT Sequence Segmentation

Foundation models like SAM2 have enabled zero-shot segmentation in natural images, but their direct application to medical image sequences faces three key limitations: reliance on manual prompts, inability to handle multiple anatomical structures, and failure to segment emerging objects absent in the initial frame due to prompt unavailability. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic Multi-Point Prompt Propagation model (MP3), a training-free enhancement framework for robust and generalizable CT sequence segmentation. MP3 introduces three key modules: (1) a Prior-Guided Prompt Initialization module that automatically generates point, box, or mask prompts using external networks; (2) a Multi-Initiation Anomaly Frame Perception module that detects object appearance or disappearance in later frames and injects new prompts for re-guidance; and (3) a Prompt-Guided Multi-Path Context Fusion module that fuses forward and backward segmentation results via soft weighting to ensure consistent and accurate predictions. Extensive experiments on public abdominal CT datasets demonstrate that MP3 significantly outperforms existing prompt-based segmentation methods in accuracy and robustness. Moreover, it generalizes well to cross-domain scenarios without requiring additional fine-tuning, highlighting its potential as an efficient, low-cost solution for clinical CT volume and sequence segmentation.
